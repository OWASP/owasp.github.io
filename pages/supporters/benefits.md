### Corporate Supporter package descriptions

### Corporate Supporter Logo

Corporate Supporters can use our new Corporate Supporter logos on your website and marketing to demonstrate their support for OWASP. 

### Support OWASP Chapters or Projects

Corporate Supporters have the option to allocate 10% of their dues to support either OWASP Chapters or Projects. While you may select a specific chapter or project, the funds will ultimately contribute to advancing OWASP's overall mission. OWASP will add this contribution to the expenses pool with no administrative fee to benefit our Chapters or Projects. In return, participating Chapters or Projects may add your logo to their home page and are encouraged to recognize your contribution at the start of meetings or in the project's deliverable, where possible.

### Corporate Sponsorship of participating AppSec Days events

Corporate Supporters can obtain early access to sponsor participating AppSec Day regional events. AppSec Days sponsorship fees vary from event to event, so please get in touch with us for details. 

NB: Not all AppSec Day regional events participate in this benefit. Please contact us to connect you with the relevant Event Leadership team.

### Early bird Global AppSec registrations

Many employers offer conferences as an employment benefit. Your staff can take advantage of an Early Bird Global AppSec Registration discount code to save on a full conference pass. This code provides access to the OWASP Member discount, even for non-members. However, this benefit does not stack with an individual membership discount, and it does not apply to training sessions.

| Package  | Global AppSec H1  | Global AppSec H2  |
| -------- | :---------------: | :---------------: |
| Platinum | 10 discount codes | 10 discount codes |
| Gold     | 5 discount codes  | 5 discount codes  |
| Silver | 1 discount code   | 1 discount code   |

Please [Contact Us](mailto:kelly.santalucia@owasp.com) for your discount code entitlements for each event to ensure your staff doesn't miss out. The discount codes are only valid for the relevant Global AppSec registration period and are not transferrable to another event.

* Global AppSec H1 is usually held in Europe in the first half of the year
* Global AppSec H2 is usually held in North America in the second half of the year

### Your logo on OWASP.org

Corporate Supporters get their logo and a descriptive blurb on the OWASP.org website, which appear on our [supporters page](/supporters/list) and randomly at the bottom of every page on owasp.org. 

- Platinum Large size (300px)
- Gold Medium size (250px)
- Silver Standard size (150px)

We will work with you to obtain a transparent icon of 300px X 90px at 72dpi. Our website automatically sizes your icon per the Corporate Supporter level.

### Rotation Priority

Our updated Corporate Supporter program implements improved rotation for Platinum and Gold supporters while still providing a great deal of exposure for Silver supporters. Platinum supporters will receive a 20% boost over a Silver supporter, Gold is 10% more likely to be shown than Silver, and our Silver supporters will share the residual rotation. OWASP.org website traffic has grown dramatically since 2019, with more than 4 million monthly page views. Hence, our Silver supporters still receive more views than in 2019, despite the lower ratio.

### Social Media Recognition

Your company will be recognized for supporting the OWASP Foundation as a Corporate Supporter on the OWASP social media platforms. Platinum Corporate Supporters will receive one social post, provided by OWASP once per quarter. Gold Corporate Supporters will receive one social post, provided by OWASP twice a year. Silver and Start-Up Corporate Supporters will receive one social post, provided by OWASP.

### Early access to Global AppSec Exhibitor/Sponsorship Packages

Global AppSec Event Sponsorships are usually entirely sold out very quickly. You might miss out on your preferred location or desired package. The Platinum Corporate Supporter benefit gives early access to the best packages, prime locations, and the best-sized booths, with the most benefits!

### Global AppSec Corporate Event Exhibitor/Sponsorship Subsidy

Up to USD 2,500 of your Corporate Supporter fee can be applied towards a Global AppSec exhibitor package.

| Package | Standard | Regional | Startup |
| -- | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Platinum | 2,500 | 1,000 |
| Gold | 1,500 | 600 |  
| Silver | 500 | 200 | 200 | 

### Option to provide an OWASP Individual Member benefit (must meet OWASP approval)

Available for Platinum and Gold Corporate Supporters. 
Provide OWASP members with an individual member benefit, such as an easy-to-use developer-first encryption-as-code platform or hands-on application security training. Contact us for more details. 

### Job Posting Board

Available for Platinum and Gold Corporate Supporters. 
Company logo and URL to your hiring page are displayed on OWASP's Job Posting web page.

### Optional Recorded Session with OWASP's Executive Director

Platinum Corporate Supporters will have a scheduled 10–15-minute recorded session with OWASP's Executive Director to share why they support OWASP and how being part of the organization benefits their company. Each recording will be featured on the OWASP.org homepage for one month.
