## Why Become an OWASP Corporate Supporter

Corporate Supporter funds collected directly support OWASP's mission, helping to fund scholarships, our Projects, Chapters, and more! Funds provided by Corporate Supporters assist Projects with hiring graphical designers, user experience experts, contract development, document writers, and other hourly support personnel, as well as providing project-related pamphlets, brochures, stickers, and similar project-identifying material. They contribute to our Chapters, allowing them to secure venue space for Chapter meetings, promotional material to help promote the OWASP mission, assist in travel expenses for incoming speakers/presenters, etc.

Many of our most well-known organizations have grown their business dramatically by being an OWASP Corporate Supporter and partnering with us. Our updated Corporate Supporter packages provide you the opportunity to get involved with the OWASP community.
