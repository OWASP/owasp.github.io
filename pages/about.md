The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is a nonprofit foundation that works to improve the security of software. Our programming includes:

- Community-led open source software projects
- Over 250+ local chapters worldwide
- Tens of thousands of members
- Industry-leading educational and training conferences

We are an open community dedicated to enabling organizations to conceive, develop, acquire, operate, and maintain applications that can be trusted. All of our projects, tools, documents, forums, and chapters are free and open to anyone interested in improving application security. The OWASP Foundation launched on December 1st, 2001, becoming incorporated as a United States non-profit charity on April 21, 2004.

For two decades corporations, foundations, developers, and volunteers have supported the OWASP Foundation and its work. [Donate](/donate), [Become a Member](/membership), or become a [Corporate Supporter](/supporters) today.
