## Securing the Web for Everyone

OWASP is a radically transparent organization. At least 77% of all funds in 2020 went directly to programs, despite a huge drop in our income. We are committed to ensuring each every dollar we receive through memberships, donations, gifts, and event sponsorships are spent frugally, responsibly, and on our mission. We are currently reforming our finances to ensure that no matter what our income is, more than 80% of all funds are spent directly on program delivery to benefit our mission, and not sunk into excessive marketing costs or general administration overheads. 

The OWASP Foundation is deeply committed to making apps more secure - and our industry more inclusive. Pictured above is a recent Introduction to AppSec Training Class at our Global AppSec Conference that was offered at no charge to diversity candidates. The Women in AppSec, Diversity and Inclusion Committee has championed this effort and is making progress at increasing the diversity of the AppSec community. The Women In AppSec, Diversity, and Inclusion Committee that has the same organizational focus as projects, events, and chapters.

OWASP offers discounted membership dues for corporate memberships, students, and people living in developing economies. We are committed to ensuring the entire world has access to OWASP's materials, projects, events, and chapters, no matter where you are located. And of course, all of OWASP Projects, Chapters, Local Meetings, and many events are free and open to all attendees.

## Chapter & Project Resources

Whilst they exist, chapter and Project balances can be found in each month's financial package on the historical Board minutes. The current plan is to abolish these balances to allow all chapters, all projects, and all events to expense per an overall expense category, determined annually by the Global Board of Directors, and topped up with donations, memberships, grants, and sponsorships.
