  - Topic - The Security Problem and The Security Solution

Sanjay WS is a CTO of Astiotech Sdn Bhd and MVP Entreprise Security. In
this session, I would like to share the security problems that are still
plaguing Windows users until we see a worldwide pandemic security fear
recently on ransomware. We walkthrough the historical security journey
of Windows users and what Microsoft has done to address them. In Windows
10, Microsoft claims to have a silver bullet approach alongside other
security primers in Windows 10, will it make the cut? You decide. I also
hope to present a custom compromise in Windows that can easily be
exploited in any version of Windows and let’s turn on this security
solution and see if it survives.

Walter Wong is a technical lead in Gain Secure, a Malaysian-based
company. The company specialized for providing secure application
development and user experience (UX) consultation services to customers.
Walter is a Microsoft MVP for developer security and Microsoft Azure.
Research on application development security is Walter's personal
interest. He also successfully discovered many websites vulnerabilities
including some high traffic websites over the past few years. Walter
often speaks at technical conferences such as Visual Studio 2010 Launch,
TechEd SEA, Security Symposium, TechNet/MSDN, Tech Insights and more.
Hosting the application in the cloud infrastructure does not guaranty
your application and data security by default. It’s developer
responsibility to ensure the application developed, configured and
hosted is secure by default. Come and join Walter in his demo packed
rollercoaster ride to understand more about Microsoft Azure security
features. If you looking forward for a demo how to break the application
hosted in Azure, this is the session you don’t want to miss.

Abstract: Zero day malware detection/prevention using open source
software - Proof of Concept Today, as computer attacks tend to be
malware-centric, the cyber criminals have introduced sophistication in
their attack techniques that makes the traditional way of protecting the
enterprise with firewalls, intrusion detection systems and antivirus
software at the network perimeter ineffective. While maintaining
Honeypot technology to collect malware information from the Internet &
internal organizations, we would like to present a proof on concept on
mitigating zero day malware using several combination of open source
projects involving malware collection from network traffic, ssl
interception, sandboxing. evading anti-vm, network ids/ips, process
flow, etc. From the idea, we are welcoming contributions & collaboration
from the public & education sector.

Abstract: Advance Financial Malware: GameOver Zeus - The art of
espionage, data ex-filtration and network disruption GameOver ZeuS (GoZ)
is the most sophisticated & the most researched malware to date. Since
the released of the 2nd version of the original gruesome ZeuS malware,
the new variant so-called “gameover” comes with a different strength and
capabilities. It is more resilient, stealthy and deadly. It has cause
the lost of millions of dollars and there are no specific methods to
stop it. This has forced the FBI to put a bounty head for its creator.

Without any leading leaked source codes on its new capabilities &
strength, most leading knowledge on GoZ is based on a 2 years of
“assumption” from various threat intelligence's collected share data
around the globe. The assumption date were derived from analyzing its
network behavior and some reverse-engineered dumped codes since 2013.

This presentation contents will be based on the collaborate data that
has been collected by Infoblox's Threat Intelligence group. The focus
will be in discussing GoZ capabilities, how to detect & mitigate it.

Abstract: An Analysis of Recent Cyber Attacks Over the past year, cyber
attacks have gone from being a worst-case scenario for security teams to
a real-world certainty. Yet for all the recent investment and focus on
cyber security, attackers continue to succeed at stealing or destroying
our most valued assets. In this discussion, we will deconstruct recent
cyber attacks to see what is working in security and where the industry
still has gaps. Then we will go beyond the search for simplistic silver
bullets, and propose new models of defense-in-depth that can apply
generically to detecting today's most sophisticated attacks.

This session will cover: - An analysis of recent cyber attacks and what
they have in common - Understanding the inherent advantages attackers
enjoy today, and how we can turn the tables - Proposing a repeatable
methodology for automating the detection of breaches and APTs

Bio: Ken Too Ken Too is a Technical Director for Datapath Networks Sdn
Bhd, focused on solutions using machine learning and data science that
provide protection beyond the perimeter. Ken has a long history in
security and had been working with HP & CSC. His discussion will
deconstruct recent cyber attacks and how they are unfolding globally
with a goal to propose repeatable and generic solutions to prevent
damage to valuable assets.

Title : Capturing Web Application Threats - Virtual CMS Honeypot by
Saharudin Saat

Opensource Content Management System (CMS) is very popular and widely
used by web administrators around the world nowadays because of their
simplicity for the instant web application solution. Consequently, web
applications have increasingly been the focus of attackers because of
the unintentional web vulnerabilities that comes from the newly
introduced functionality. This project aims at enhancing the level of
security for CMS inside the Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM) network by
providing the most extensive way on developing Virtual CMS Honeypots.
The outcome is hoped to ease the web administrators to monitor any kind
of computer threats such as hackers, worms and viruses in more
comfortable and efficient way. The results also will provide the
administrator some form of countermeasures for security purposes and
traffic analysis. Using Customize Awstats, Snort, AcidBase and Proxy
will provide a Honeypot for a rapidly expandable network and suit for
the web administrator especially at UiTM to monitor webserver traffic
activity and any latest computer threats.

Title: Top Ten Web Security Defenses

We cannot “firewall” or “patch” our way to secure websites. In the past,
security professionals thought firewalls, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL),
patching, and privacy policies were enough. Today, however, these
methods are outdated and ineffective, as attacks on prominent,
well-protected websites are occurring every day. Citigroup, PBS, Sega,
Nintendo, Gawker, AT\&T, the CIA, the US Senate, NASA, Nasdaq, the NYSE,
Zynga, and thousands of others have something in common – all have had
websites compromised in the last year. No company or industry is immune.
Programmers need to learn to build websites differently. This talk will
review the top coding techniques developers need to master in order to
build a low-risk, high-security web application.
