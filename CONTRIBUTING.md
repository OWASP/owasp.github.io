This is the source code for the root web pages in https://owasp.org/

The website is generated using [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/pages). We use a [custom theme](https://github.com/owasp/www--site-theme/).

To contribute to this repository, you will need to have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/). You can make edits using the integrated editor in GitHub and then open a PR (pull request).

If you need to edit multiple files, or if you want to check the resulting pages before posting a pull request, you can download Jekyll and use it locally.
