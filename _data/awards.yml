      Each year there are many individuals who do amazing work, dedicating countless hours to share, improve, 
      and strengthen the OWASP mission. Some of these individuals are well known to the community while others are not.  
      The purpose of these awards is to bring recognition to those who "FLY UNDER THE RADAR". These are the individuals 
      who are passionate about OWASP, who contribute hours of their own free time to the organization to help improve 
      the cyber-security world, yet seem to go unrecognized.

          Rick's focus on Web Application Security represents more than half of his 20+ year IT career. You may know him for his work as a co-lead of the ZAP project, 
          however Rick can also be credited for his contributions to the Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual (OSSTMM), Web Security Testing Guide (WSTG), 
          Vulnerable Web Applications Directory (VWAD), and OWASP community content. Rick is a security assessment and testing trainer for part of his work, a lightning talk 
          presenter at the Ottawa OWASP chapter meetings and AppSec USA, OWASP Ottawa volunteer, and has helped with project promotion assessments during previous AppSec USA 
          conferences. Rick enjoys helping others learn and challenge themselves, and strongly believes that together we can and do make the industry better.
