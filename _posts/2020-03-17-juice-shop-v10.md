Releasing
[Juice Shop `v10.0.0`](https://github.com/bkimminich/juice-shop/releases/tag/v10.0.0)
live from the beach of Cancun at the OWASP Projects Summit was a really
unique event. The summit allowed us to really concentrate on some larger
long-term ideas we had.<!--more-->

One of them was harmonizing the UI/UX, especially in the recently
extended checkout process. Another was adding more tutorial scripts for
the
[Hacking Instructor](https://pwning.owasp-juice.shop/part1/challenges.html#hacking-instructor)
that guides beginners through some of the easier challenges in the Juice
Shop.

But also some spontaneous ideas were implemented in Mexico, such as a
GitHub Action called LMLFTFY ("Let me `lint:fix` that for you") that -
if necessary - does exactly what the name suggests after each `git
push`.

Juice Shop 10 also contains many other enhancements from before the
summit: The Angular 8 to 9 migration; a refactoring of the structure &
naming in the customization YAML file format; a brand new Prometheus
metrics endpoint that delivers application health stats, "business KPIs"
and challenge progress information.

The latter already has one happy consumer: The convenient
Kubernetes-based
[MultiJuicer `v3.0.0`](https://github.com/iteratec/multi-juicer)
platform already adds a fancy Grafana dashboard per Juice Shop instance
running on it. The metrics can for example help trainers to keep track
of how their students are doing with challenges. They also allow them to
provide better technical troubleshooting thanks to real-time log
monitoring. Please note that only MultiJuicer 3.x is compatible with
Juice Shop 10.x.
