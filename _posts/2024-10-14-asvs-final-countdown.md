## Introduction

We are on the final countdown to the release of the [OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS)](https://asvs.owasp.org) version 5.0!

The ASVS leaders and several other contributors will be meeting at the [OWASP Project Summit](https://owaspprojectsummit.org/) in November to pull together a release candidate of the updated requirements for ASVS 5.0.

This will be a major release with a lot of changes to bring the ASVS up to date and make it more usable

Over the next couple of weeks, we will be announcing that certain chapters are ready for public review and we would welcome your input.

## We need your help

Please look out for Social Media and Slack announcements over the next couple of weeks about chapters that are ready for review.

At this stage, we are looking for comments on aspects that will be finalised during the project summmit, see below. 

Following the project summit, we will be seeking feedback on a more final draft of the standard with the aim of releasing the final version by the end of the year.

### What will be finalised during the Project Summit

We will be actively seeking review comments on these items in advance of and during the summit.

* Requirement wording
* Requirement location (chapter and section)
* Chapter text
* Level definitions. See the discussions [here](https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS/discussions/1839).

### What will remain afterwards

We will be actively seeking review comments on these items after the summit.

* Renumbering (including chapter numbering)
* Setting levels.
* Changing the [current change tagging](https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#standard-for-changes) into a separate change log.
* Mapping to OWASP CRE.
* Introductory text separate to the chapters 
* The appendix sections.
