Stacey joins OWASP from IriusRisk, where she served as Field & Partner Marketing Manager for EMEA, leading regional campaigns, managing partner and social strategy, and driving global community engagement through initiatives like the Threat Modeling Connect community. She has been a key organizer for conferences and events worldwide and currently serves as one of the London Chapter Leaders for Threat Modeling Connect.

Her career also includes event and marketing leadership roles at F-Secure Consulting and Apple Retail UK, where she honed her expertise in communications strategy, partner relations, and brand development. Stacey’s extensive experience in coordinating global events, producing compelling marketing content, and fostering community collaboration aligns perfectly with OWASP’s mission to improve application security worldwide.

A long-time advocate of OWASP’s values, Stacey brings both professional experience and personal passion to her new role. Her work at the intersection of marketing, community building, and cybersecurity will help OWASP strengthen member engagement, amplify global initiatives, and tell the story of OWASP’s impact as it approaches its 25th Anniversary.

"I’m thrilled to welcome Stacey Ebbs as the OWASP Foundation’s first-ever Communications and Marketing Manager. With deep experience engaging developers, AppSec professionals, and industry leaders, Stacey will lead a strategic refresh of how OWASP tells its story through compelling social media, case studies, annual reports, and community-driven content. As she refines our marketing approach with a focus on our core values of openness, transparency, integrity, and vendor neutrality, Stacey will collaborate closely with our community, leaders, and staff to spotlight the incredible work behind our projects, chapters, events, donors, sponsors, and supporters. Stacey arrives just in time for OWASP’s 25th Anniversary! Please welcome Stacey to our team - I'm sure you'll be hearing from her soon.", says Andrew van der Stock, Executive Director of the OWASP Foundation.  

Stacey will begin her role by collaborating with OWASP’s leadership and community teams to refine global communications, enhance outreach to chapters and members, and lead initiatives around OWASP’s milestone anniversary celebrations.
