title:  Global AppSec Dublin postponed to 2021
excerpt_separator: <!--more-->

Following recent developments within Ireland, throughout Europe, and worldwide relating to COVID-19, the OWASP Foundation has made the difficult, but considered decision, to postpone the Global AppSec Dublin set to take place June 15-19.

We take pride in offering a premier experience for our attendees and sponsors and we can no longer guarantee that event quality. Nor can we ethically put our communityâ€™s health and safety at risk. Therefore we have secured dates at the Convention Center Dublin to hold the Global AppSec Dublin on **February 15-19, 2021**.

We are working on ways to still deliver value to the OWASP community in 2020. While we continue to monitor the situation, we are confident that the Global AppSec San Francisco *will still take place* October 19-23, 2020. Call for papers will be open March 23 and more details can be found at [Global AppSec San Francisco](https://sf.globalappsec.org){:target='_blank' rel='noopener'}.
