As part of the OWASP & We Hack Purple partnership, all OWASP members are now provided free access to the Application Security Foundations Level 1 course from WHP! This introductory AppSec course will answer all your burning questions and define all the technical terms right at the start. Then we will set goals for your AppSec program at work as an exercise. After this, we dive deep into every type of application security activity and tool on the market while sprinkling you with quizzes and exercises. As a final project, we make an AppSec program action plan for you to bring back to work with you. This on-demand course is FREE for all OWASP members! 

To access the course, read on, sign up with your OWASP.org email address, and start learning.

We Hack Purple's Application Security Foundations Level 1 course consists of 108 short modules. It is virtually trained by Tanya Janca of We Hack Purple fame. All you need to do is be an OWASP member and sign up! If you're not a member, joining or renewing a lapsed OWASP membership is easy! Just remember to sign up for your included owasp.org email so you can complete the We Hack Purple registration process.

Thank you so much to We Hack Purple for this partnership and such a wonderful and courageous donation, essentially giving away their AppSec Fundamentals course! I love the spirit of sharing and community, and nothing demonstrates this more to me than helping developers and new appsec practitioners get access to high-quality training.
