The OWASP Foundation is a not-for-profit organization providing open-source projects, tools, documentation, etc., to help security professionals succeed by improving to keep their company's data secure! Our open-source materials are supported by the financial contributions of our Corporate Members, and they are fundamentally important to help us continue to fulfill our mission by providing these resources. As a corporate member, supporting the OWASP Foundation demonstrates the companies commitment to the community, the Foundation, and the entire AppSec sector.<br> 

OWASP strives to provide opportunities to companies with all budget types so everyone can participate.  That being said, we are happy to announce that we now offer **discounted corporate membership** for companies in developing regions and discounted rates for start-up companies!  Qualify, and be one of the first ten companies to join the Foundation as a corporate member to receive a special incentive https://owasp.org/supporters/.<br>

Over the last year, the OWASP homepage has been viewed over **ONE MILLION times!** <br>
