title: Beyond the Basics - Exploring Vulnerability Management's Uncharted Territory
pitch: In the rapidly evolving realm of cybersecurity, vulnerability management has evolved beyond its traditional boundaries. In this article, we explore three directions that organizations should consider when crafting their vulnerability management strategy, i.e., embracing a collaborative approach with security researchers, harnessing the power of EPSS (Exploit Prediction Scoring System) for improved vulnerability remediation prioritization, and implementing Responsible Handling of Vulnerability Exceptions.

### Collaborative Approach with Security Researchers
One of the most effective strategies in bolstering your cybersecurity defences is to tap into the collective expertise of the cybersecurity community. Bug bounty programs provide a structured platform for white-hat researchers to report potential security vulnerabilities that may have eluded the organization's internal vulnerability management processes. Even if a full-fledged bug bounty program isn't feasible, setting up a basic protocol for independent vulnerability research and establishing communication channels for reporting potential vulnerabilities should be considered a minimum requirement. Take, for instance, the implementation of ["security.txt"](https://securitytxt.org/), a plain text file placed in a website's root directory. This file provides clear instructions to security researchers on how to report vulnerabilities securely, preventing potentially critical security issues from going unreported.

### EPSS for Prioritizing Vulnerability Remediation Efforts
In the sizable and complex landscape of large organizations, prioritizing vulnerability remediation can feel like searching for a needle in a haystack. This is where the [Exploit Prediction Scoring System (EPSS)](https://www.first.org/epss/) enters the picture. EPSS harnesses the power of threat intelligence, historical attack data, and machine learning to predict the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited in the wild. By assigning predictive scores to vulnerabilities, organizations can concentrate their efforts on the most critical security risks, facilitating informed decision-making and efficient resource allocation. This innovative system allows organizations to stay one step ahead in the cybersecurity race.

### Responsible Handling of Vulnerability Exceptions
In the complex world of cybersecurity, there will be scenarios where exceptions to standard vulnerability remediation practices are warranted. When dealing with these exceptions, a well-documented process is essential. It should include a detailed risk assessment outcome, taking into account factors such as the potential impact of the vulnerability, the likelihood of exploitation, and any compensating controls that can mitigate the risk. It is crucial to maintain a balance for risk acceptance not just simply signing off by the system or application owner, but with a precise risk quantification process to determine the appropriate approval workflow. Furthermore, setting an expiry date for exceptions is crucial, ensuring that they are periodically reviewed for potential extension or termination.

### Conclusion
In today's digital landscape, vulnerability management is no longer a static process but a dynamic and evolving challenge. Cybersecurity is a collective effort, and by embracing innovation and responsible practices, we can all contribute to a safer digital world.
