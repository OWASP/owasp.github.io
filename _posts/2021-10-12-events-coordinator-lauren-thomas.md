I am very pleased to announce that the OWASP Foundation has recruited [Lauren Thomas](https://owasp.org/corporate/) as our new Events Coordinator. I'm sure those of you involved with Events will welcome Lauren's appointment!

<--more-->

Lauren comes to OWASP with a wealth of events experience, and will be helping us with all things events: AppSec Globals, AppSec Days, training, virtual events, and assisting the OWASP events community. Some of her first tasks will be to work on the forthcoming [AppSec Virtual](https://usa.globalappsec.org/), and working with the community to improve Events In A Box and our events budgeting templates.

In other Events news, we will be running a series of Event Town Halls in November. Please keep an eye on the [OWASP Foundation Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/owaspfoundation/) to RSVP to these town halls if you are an event organizer, trainer,  sponsors, speaker, or just an attendee who wishes things to be better. We'll be talking about our new events policy, trainer splits, and more.

Please come say hello and welcome to Lauren on the OWASP Slack.
