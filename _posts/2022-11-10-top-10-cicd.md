OWASP, and specifically the “Top 10 Web Application Security Risks” framework, has had a crucial influence on the AppSec industry, both in relation to informing methodologies and thought patterns, as well as shaping the landscape of Web Application Security technologies. 

To this day, OWASP continues to play a pivotal role in shaping the trajectory of the AppSec domain through an amazing community and infrastructure that allows AppSec practitioners all across the globe to build, share and spread knowledge around anything AppSec related. 

Cider Security is honored to contribute the “Top 10 CI/CD Security Risks'' framework - a result of over 9 months of extensive research and analysis by some of the best minds the AppSec industry has to offer to the OWASP community.<br>
The AppSec domain has been undergoing a massive evolution over the last 2-3 years, with many new areas of focus appended to the scope of responsibilities of the AppSec practitioner. 
This contribution will assist the community to continue building a solid foundation of knowledge and context that will allow a smooth transition into this new AppSec area.

Cider Security, the main sponsor the of “Top 10 CI/CD Security Risks” framework, will remain highly committed to the cause of building and providing foundational knowledge to OWASP and the rest of the infosec community, to ensure it remains vigilant and continue successfully adapting to the evolving CI/CD security risk landscape.
