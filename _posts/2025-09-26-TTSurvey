## Help Shape the Future of Web Application Security: OWASP Top 10 - 2025 Community Survey Now Open

The digital threat landscape is constantly evolving-and so are the ways we defend against it. At the heart of that defense is the **OWASP Top 10**, a globally recognized standard for web application security. It's more than just a list; it's a reflection of what the security community sees, experiences, and prioritizes in real-time.

And now, as we look ahead to **OWASP Top 10 - 2025**, we're calling on the global AppSec and development community to lend their voices, expertise, and perspectives to this critical update.

### Why Your Voice Matters

The OWASP Top 10 isn't decided behind closed doors-it's a collaborative effort driven by real-world data and informed by practitioners on the front lines. Your feedback ensures this list remains not only technically accurate, but also relevant, inclusive, and actionable for organizations and teams of all sizes and structures.

Whether you're a seasoned security leader, a developer who's learned through hard-won experience, or someone just getting started in the field-**you have something valuable to contribute.**

### What We're Asking

We're gathering input through a brief, focused survey designed to capture what you're seeing today and where you think the future of web security is headed. From emerging threats to shifting priorities, this is your opportunity to help guide what will become a foundational resource for developers, educators, auditors, and companies around the world.

**The deadline to submit feedback is October 3, 2025.**

### Let's Build This Together

Security is a shared responsibility. So is progress. The OWASP community has always been grounded in openness, transparency, and collective wisdom-and this next iteration of the Top 10 is no different.

Make your voice heard. Share the link. Encourage your peers and teams to participate. The more perspectives we gather, the stronger and more representative the final OWASP Top 10 - 2025 will be.

Let's move the industry forward, together.
