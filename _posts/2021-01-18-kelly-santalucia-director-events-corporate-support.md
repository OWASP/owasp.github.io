It is my pleasure to announce Kelly Santalucia's appointment as OWASP's Director of Events and Corporate Support, effective January 1, 2021. In December 2020, our previous Events Director, Emily Berman, chose to move on to a new events opportunity, and I thank her for her efforts during her tenure. 

> I am honored and excited to serve the OWASP Community as your Director of Events and Corporate Support. I have been a team member of the Foundation for over ten years. I began my journey here at OWASP as the NYC local chapter coordinator under Tom Brennan's leadership. Shortly after, an opportunity became available, and I joined the OWASP global staff as the Foundations Membership and Business Liaison. As the years progressed, I moved into the Senior Manager of Sponsorship and Membership role, followed by the Director of Corporate Support and, most recently, the Director of Events and Corporate Support.

> I have seen tremendous growth in OWASP over the years, and the Foundation accomplish many successful milestones. I have met hundreds of passionate and extraordinary individuals, and it is their countless hours of volunteering that has significantly contributed to the success of the Foundation. Without these individuals, OWASP would not be who we are today. One of my priorities is to create opportunities for our global community members to become involved again in THEIR organization.
> Although the last year has been challenging, and unfortunately, there continues to be much uncertainty in 2021, we are hopeful that we will once again get to a "safe time" where we can begin hosting face-to-face events. Until then, we strive to offer as many valuable, virtual opportunities for the community to remain involved with the Foundation and its peers. While some of our pre-planned 2021 events are industry-specific, we are excited to offer some fun networking activities. These activities will provide you the opportunity to sit back and enjoy some simple, fun, and interactive virtual networking time with other community members. We hope you will join us!

Alonna Stock, our Senior Events Manager, reports to and will ably support Kelly in organizing all our events, as well as supporting our community as they start to safely return to in person local and regional events. In the meantime, we have a fantastic line up of virtual events, call to battles, training, and fun events, and a single Global AppSec later this year. Stay tuned for these announcements and more!

OWASP Events are genuinely the best place on Earth to learn about new research, connect with your peers, learn new skills, and stay in the forefront of application security throughout the year and all over the world. No one else comes close to our reach and core mission. I am excited to see what our community and the Events team comes up with next!
